The question to answer is why are students’ grades the way they are. Are there features of a student’s life that can predict their success in school. The outcome of this study might help combat some inequalities that lead to poor grades and or suggest life choices that can increase success in school. The goal of the project is to create a model that can successfully predict the grade average of a student based on their social and economic characteristics. There will be four different model types that will be fit to the data and the best will be chosen based on their rmse value, which is in the simplest of terms the difference between the predictions and the true values of the grade average.
